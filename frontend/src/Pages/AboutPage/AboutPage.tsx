              Welcome to HokieHomes, an app designed by passionate students for Virginia Tech's community! HokieHomes was created during VTHacks 12â€”Virginia Tech's annual hackathonâ€”to provide a platform where students can share honest reviews and experiences of dorm life on campus. Whether you're a new Hokie looking for your first dorm or a current student seeking a change, HokieHomes offers you the insights you need to make informed housing decisions.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              We believe that where you live has a major impact on your college experience, and finding the right dorm is key to a successful and enjoyable time at Virginia Tech. HokieHomes allows you to:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Browse reviews from fellow students</li>
              <li>View ratings on aspects like cleanliness, community, and proximity to key campus locations</li>
              <li>Share your own experiences and feedback to help future residents</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              Our goal is to foster a more transparent and connected housing experience for all Hokies. Weâ€™re committed to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion, ensuring every student feels welcome and supported in their on-campus home.
            </p>
